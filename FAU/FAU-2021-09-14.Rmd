# Data wrangling

## Exercise


Which three airlines do show the greatest average delay in the first quarter?

(Use the tidyverse approach.)

You'll find the data set (including description) [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/nycflights13/flights.html).

## Solution


### In pseudo code

take data "flights" THEN
select month jan to march THEN
select delay THEN
summarise mean delay
arrange mean delay from biggest to smallest THEN
filter delay the three largest mean delays
